        <p>
            Do not stand at my grave and weep<br>
            I am not there; I do not sleep.<br>
            I am a thousand winds that blow,<br>
            I am the diamond glints on snow,<br>
            I am the sun on ripened grain,<br>
            I am the gentle autumn rain.<br>
            When you awaken in the morning's hush<br>
            I am the swift uplifting rush<br>
            Of quiet birds in circled flight.<br>
            I am the soft stars that shine at night.<br>
            Do not stand at my grave and cry,<br>
            I am not there; I did not die.<br>
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
            Flow down, cold rivulet, to the sea,<br>
            Thy tribute wave deliver:<br>
            No more by the my steps shall be,<br>
            For ever and for ever.<br>
            
            Flow, softly flow, by lawn and lea,<br>
            A rivulet then a river:<br>
            Nowhere by thee my steps shall be<br>
            For ever and for ever.<br>
            
            But here will sigh thine alder tree<br>
            And here thine aspen shiver;<br>
            And here by thee will hum the bee,<br>
            For ever and for ever.<br>
            
            A thousand suns will stream on thee,<br>
            A thousand moons will quiver;<br>
            But not by thee my steps shall be,<br>
            For ever and for ever<br>

            My hamster's name is whisker<br>
            He is as white as snow <br>
            His coat is as smooth as silk<br>
            He is only 8 months old<br>
            He is as bold as a knight<br>
            He likes to play all night<br>
            He is as light as a feather<br>
            And I love to play with him in all weather<br>

            The wind pushed and trashed<br>
            The trees howled and bent<br>
            Clouds were roaring loud<br>
            The vines got caught in a fight<br>
            The grass kept low<br>
            The sun was dim<br>
            It was not a good day to swim<br>

            My mother is an angel<br>
            She is sweet and sour<br>
            She cooked me my favorte meal<br>
            Her touch is like a heal<br>
            She gives me everything i need<br>
            She is my sunshine<br>
